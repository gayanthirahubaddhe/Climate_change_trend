🌍 Global Warming Trend Analysis - City Temperature Data
This project analyzes long-term temperature trends across thousands of global cities using R. 
The goal is to identify patterns of climate warming, understand regional and hemispheric 
differences, and highlight the most affected areas.

📊 Objectives
🌡️ Analyze temperature trends in cities worldwide over time
🌍 Compare warming rates across regions and hemispheres
🚦 Classify cities into risk zones based on warming intensity
🔥 Identify cities with the fastest warming trends
📉 Examine areas with the lowest or slowest warming rates
